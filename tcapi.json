And revenue has grown 200% this year.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>That may not be surprising, given the overall growth in e-commerce during the pandemic. As Lapeyre put it, merchants saw &#8220;a huge boost&#8221; in online orders, which resulted in a similar rise in customer service requests \u2014 so they&#8217;re increasingly turning to Gorgias for help.</p>\n<p>Initially, Lapeyre said merchants are just eager to respond to their customers more quickly and to make their support team more efficient. But over time, they become more interested in using customer support &#8220;as way to drive sales.&#8221; In fact, he recalled talking to one business that used to compensate its support team based on response time and now offers them a sales commission.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1916983\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1916983\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1916983\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?w=680\" alt=\"Gorgias screenshot\" width=\"680\" height=\"517\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?resize=300,228 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?resize=768,584 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?resize=680,517 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1916983\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gorgias</p></div></p>\n<p>He said he expects these trends to continue after the pandemic ends: &#8220;We just jumped five years into the future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gorgias has now raised a total of $40 million.
